# Code Review

## Code Review Goals

- Improving code and product quality
- Spreading knowledge within the team
- Detecting errors at early stages
- Ensuring compliance with standards and guidelines
- Improving architectural integrity

## Code Review Principles

- Respect and constructiveness - focus on the code, not the author
- Timeliness - code review should be performed quickly to avoid delaying development
- Thoroughness - quality of review is more important than speed
- Learning - code review should help developers grow
- Shared responsibility - code belongs to the entire team, not individual authors

## Code Review Process

1. Preparing code for review

   - The author ensures code compliance with standards
   - Code passes automated checks (linters, tests)
   - A Pull Request is created with a detailed description of changes

2. Assigning reviewers

   - Minimum two reviewers for each PR
   - One reviewer - technical lead or senior developer
   - Second reviewer - developer from a related area

3. Conducting review

   - Maximum review waiting time - 24 hours
   - Optimal code size for review - up to 400 lines
   - Large changes should be split into several PRs

4. Processing comments

   - The author must respond to all comments
   - Disagreement with comments should be discussed in the comments
   - For unresolvable disagreements, the technical lead makes the decision

5. Code acceptance
   - Positive conclusion from all reviewers is required
   - Automated tests must pass successfully
   - After code acceptance, the author performs merging with the main branch

## Checklist for Code Review

1. Functionality

   - Code implements the required functionality
   - All edge cases are handled
   - Implementation corresponds to the specification

2. Code quality

   - Compliance with SOLID principles
   - No duplication
   - Clear variable and method names
   - Comments for complex code sections

3. Tests

   - Sufficient test coverage (minimum 85%)
   - Testing of edge cases
   - No fragile tests
   - Presence of not only positive but also negative scenarios. Correct error handling

4. Performance

   - Efficient algorithms and data structures
   - Optimization of DB queries
   - No N+1 problems

5. Security
   - Input data validation
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities
   - Secure handling of confidential data

## Code Review Metrics

1. Cycle time - average time from PR creation to its merging
2. Change volume - average number of lines of code in PR
3. Comment coverage - average number of comments per PR
4. Time to first response - average time to first comment

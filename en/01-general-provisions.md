# General Provisions

The main objective of this guide is to improve the speed and quality of developed products.

1. Code must follow all developer community guidelines
2. Code must be readable
3. Code must be testable
4. Code must be maintainable
5. The developed product must be easily scalable
6. Code must be written to be high-performance from the start
7. Code must be reusable
8. We are making a product, not just writing code. This means that we ourselves should also enjoy using the product.
9. Each developer is responsible for the results of their work and the operational reliability of the system.
10. It is necessary to simplify code as much as possible and not use unproven practices and tools
11. When needing to fix another developer's code - it is necessary to discuss the changes with them
12. The codebase should contain only used functionality and related comments. Everything else should be removed.
13. Code should be written in such a way that the system continues to work in case of possible failures. In case of a crash, the system should recover on its own
14. Untested code should not be deployed
15. Work follows the zero bug policy principle - errors should not accumulate in the backlog
